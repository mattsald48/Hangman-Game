# Hangman-Game

A Star Wars themed hangman game. To start press any key. Play will commence like a normal hangman game. You must guess the correct character without using up all your chances.  To the left is a translator that turn regular english into the star wars language of Aurebesh. 

I plan to implement this portion into the game.  In place of blanks the Aurebesh letter will be translated into english.
